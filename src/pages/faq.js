    <h3>Race Etiquette</h3>
    <p>Arrive early on race day, especially if you are picking up your race bib. Remember that there are many other people going through the same process; parking, baggage check, bathroom, etc.
    Pin your race bib on your front so it is visible for race officials and photographers.</p>
    <p>Line up based on how fast you plan to run or walk the event. Slower participants should position themselves at the back of the start group. Unless you are racing for an overall or age category award, please do not position yourself right on the start line.</p>
    <p>If you are walking in a group, stay to the back of the pack at the start line and walk no more than two abreast.</p>
    <p>Wheelchairs and baby strollers should line up at the back of the pack at the start line.</p>
    <p>If you need to shed layers of clothing at the start of the race, tie them around your waist or put them on the side of the road where no one will trip over them. Note: we will collect all discarded clothing and donate it to charity.</p>
    <p>Run or walk no more than two abreast.</p>
    <p>If you want to pass someone, say “excuse me” or “on your left” and pass on the left.</p>
    <p>If you hear someone say “excuse me” or “on your left”, move to the right and allow the person to pass without blocking their effort.</p>
    <p>If you need to stop for any reason (tie your shoe, stretch, etc.), put your hand up to alert those behind you and move to the side of the road.</p>
    <h3>Water Station Etiquette</h3>
    <p>When approaching a water station, move to the side of the road, grab water and keep moving. Throw your used cup to the side of the road as close to the water station as possible. Drop your cup down by your waist so you don’t hit/splash another participant.</p>
    <h3>Finish Line Etiquette</h3>
    <p>As you approach the finish line, if you are listening to something on your headphones, please turn it off so that you can hear the instructions through the finish chute.</p>
    <p>Follow the instructions of the race officials in the finish chute.</p>
    <p>The course and finish area are closed for registered participants only. Please DO NOT bring your friends, family and/or children through the finish chute with you.</p>
    <p>Once you have crossed the finish line be considerate of those behind you and keep moving forward until you exit the finish chute.</p>
    <p>Plan to meet family and friends outside the finish chute at a predetermined location. The finish area is a very busy place; choose a specific location to meet. Do NOT plan to meet them within the finish chute; you will be asked to move along.</p>
